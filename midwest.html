            <i>royalist:</i>  As ever, you and your kind are on the wrong side of history. It's not some hippie revival in the hackspaces that will win the day, far from it. The networks you rely on for your delocalised tinkering have already given birth to a new science; and its name is Data Science; and its Data shall be Big. </br> </br>
	    <i>nomad:</i>  We shall not endure the operations that are perfomed on us. Saint Judith tells us that identity is an effect of performance, not vice versa, that our identity is constructed in the actual sites of othering encounters (not forgetting that technology is also an actor). So we shall act. As our data is always ambiguous, we shall Glitch; becoming the discontinuities and unexpected artefacts in the big data you crave.</br> </br>
